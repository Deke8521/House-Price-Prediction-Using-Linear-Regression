# House-Price-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict house prices in King County, USA. The dataset used for this task, houseprice_data.csv, contains information about house sales with 18 features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, etc., and a target variable: price.

## Data Analysis and Preprocessing:
Load and explore the houseprice_data.csv dataset.
Handle missing values and perform data cleaning.
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between features and the target variable.

## Model Development:
Develop a linear regression model (simple or multiple) to predict house prices.
Use as many features as possible to evaluate if the model improves with additional data.

## Model Visualization:
Visualize the model using one or two input/feature variables to illustrate relationships.

## Model Evaluation:
Assess the effectiveness of the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²).
Analyze the results and discuss the effectiveness of the model.
Outline potential improvements and further steps for model enhancement.
Conclude on the model’s performance and its practical implications.
